# Byworded.tmTheme

A theme that replicates the beautiful visual style of [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/). Unlike many standard themes, it offers full support for the Markdown syntax. Compatible with any text editor that will read **.tmTheme** files.

Requires both the Markdown and MultiMarkdown bundles (Textmate) or packages (Sublime Text).

## Installation for Textmate

Just double-click or open the **.tmTheme** file and TextMate will install it for you.

## Installation for Sublime Text

Copy both **.tmTheme** files to ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/

## Development

- Note that the syntax highlighting will not match that of Byword in all circumstances. This is due to the fact this theme is still a work in progress and because of some constraints in the Markdown/MultiMarkdown .tmLanguage files.

- The bold and italic fontStyles are currently not supported in Sublime Text 2. Please [vote on the issue here](http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/20780-implement-fontstyle-in-tmtheme/).
